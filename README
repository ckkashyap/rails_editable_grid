After looking around for a light weight editable grid for Rails for a while, I
decided to create one for myself. 

This is the first cut - 

One can use the grid from a view as follows 


<%= grid( :model => @students %> 

And it would generate a table with the some JS that allows arrow key based
navigation.  And asynchronous update using Ajax!

The idea is to add support as follows - 

<% grid( :model => @students, 
   :update_controller => "students_controller",
   :update_action => "update"
%>

Also, ability for multiuser update and asynchronous updates to the table as other
users make changes!
